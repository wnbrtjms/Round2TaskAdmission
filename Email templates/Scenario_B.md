# Scenario B

Good day **Jane**!

We have received your concerns regarding the application process for the Android class. I know how disappointing it is that despite your efforts in completing the steps and completing the pre-work app, you are marked as ineligible because you are not currently enrolled in a university or college located in the US. We want to apologize if there was confusion regarding our eligibility requirements.


Our courses are specifically targeted at students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States. We currently run classes outside the US (e.g., Haiti); however, at this moment, Thailand is not one of them. We are planning to expand to many more areas as well. If you sign up for our  [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst), weâ€™ll notify you once our classes become available in your area. 


We extremely appreciate the time the students commit during the tedious application process and you are no exception. It pains us to inform you that we will not allow you to proceed due to our strict implementation of our requirements. Your efforts are not in vain. Take all your learnings during the pre-work as an experience in learning Android.

Allow us to provide you lists of available resources online that can help you with your interest in Android.

We are looking forward to your success as an Android developer. You can do it, Jane!

If you have any more questions and concerns, feel free to message us.



All the best,

Office of Admissions
