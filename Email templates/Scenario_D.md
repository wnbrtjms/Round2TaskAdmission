# Scenario D

Hi **Dennis**!

We are glad that you completed all the requirements for the Tech Fellow application. We sincerely apologized if you haven't heard from us for more than two weeks. I know that it can be worrisome but don't worry because we don't find anything wrong with your application.

We felt your excitement for this training, and we don't want that sparkle to fade away. We have to wait for at least one more eligible Tech Fellow from San Jose State University who completed their requirements as well. Indeed, patience is a virtue in this process. But we can guarantee you that once we have another applicant from your school, we can process your admission.

In the meantime, you can browse these resources to give you an overview of the program.

All the best,

**Office of the Admission**
