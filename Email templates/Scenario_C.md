# Scenario C

Hi **Anne**!

We are grateful for showing your interest in our Summer Interview Prep course. It breaks our heart to inform you that the application is over two weeks ago. As much as we wanted to welcome you and be part of this course, as of this moment, the class is full and we cannot accommodate more students due to the long waitlist. 

Normally we can always let the applicants try our next batch of this course. However, your case is quite complicated since you will be graduating this Spring and this will make you ineligible to take our course next year. We try to make our courses available to as many people as possible that is why it breaks our heart that we cannot allow you to proceed with your application. 

We significantly appreciate your intent to enroll in our course. You shared with us that it is difficult to get offers from companies for your internship. Please allow us to help you by checking this online resources:

* [Software Engineering Internship Interview Guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view)
* [CodePath Guides and Resources](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Beginning-Android-Resources#guides)



I hope in this way, we can show our outmost care for each applicant be it an enrollee or not. We value you equally. You may sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst), so that you we can notify you in case there are future courses or virtual events that you might be interested in.


I'm wishing for your professional success, Anne. You can do it!

All the best,

Office of the Admission
