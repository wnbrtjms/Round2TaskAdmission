# Scenario A
Hi **John**,

We are grateful for your application to our **Interview Prep program**. Great job for qualifying to our **Beginner track**! You are one step closer to your professional goals.

We have read your *request* to be transferred into our Advanced track, given that you are a performing student at MIT. Thank you for reaching out regarding this matter. Upon checking your records, unfortunately, your score in the assessment didn’t meet our requirements.

The courses are built from the same curriculum we use to train professional engineers from top Silicon Valley companies, including Facebook, Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, Yahoo, and many more. We always make sure that you are placed into a class fit for your present technical skills.

We appreciate your passion and interest in transferring to the Advanced track; however, we cannot process this request. Don’t worry! You will enjoy your assigned class. In the meantime, in preparation for your upcoming class, please check the [Technical Interview Prep Course Overview ](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/intro_software_eng/overview). 


Again, congratulations and welcome to **CodePath**! If you have any more questions and concerns, feel free to message us at admissions@codepath.org


All the best,

Office of Admissions
