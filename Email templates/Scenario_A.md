# Scenario A
Hi **John**,

Thank you for your application to our *Interview Prep program*. Great job for qualifying to our **Beginner track**! You are one step closer to your professional goals.

We have read your request to be transferred into our Advanced track given that you are a performing student at MIT. Thank you for reaching out regarding this matter. Upon checking your records, your score in the assessment didn't meet our requirement for the said class.

The courses are built from the same curriculum we use to train professional engineers from top Silicon Valley companies including Facebook, Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, Yahoo and many more. We make sure that you are put into a class that is fit for your current skills.

We appreciate your passion to be admitted to the Advanced track, however, we cannot process this request. Don't worry! You will enjoy your assigned class. 


Again, congratulations and welcome to **CodePath**! If you have any more questions, feel free to message us at admissions@codepath.org


All the best,
Office of Admissions
